With the help of technology, people can buy and purchase items online without
having to shop inside. Everyday items like groceries are essential and can be purchased
conveniently. We decided to create an online grocery software to make it easier for
people to shop.
Online grocery shopping can be used by anyone, from teenagers to the elderly.
Online shopping can make the checkout process easy by simply navigating through the
application. Those who are not comfortable with crowded grocery stores or have a
disability that prevents them from leaving their home can use the online grocery shopping
application. People can also set up a pickup time if they’re busy throughout the day for
their convenience.
The software usage is relatively easy to understand from both the customer and
the employee perspective. When first using the app, the customer must log in through the
“Secure Login” window with the username and password they created. After logging in,
they can start using the “Search” window to categorize the groceries based on their
needs and wants; if needed, the customer may customize the language before accessing
the search window. The customer may “Add” however many items they wish and proceed
to checkout when done. If at any point the customer changes their mind, they may “Edit”
their cart to “Add” or “Remove” any items they like; “Customer Service” will also be
available if the customer wants external help. After reaching the “Checkout” window, it will
display the total price of the customer’s order along with the option to set a date and time
for pickup. The Manager will be able to edit the store inventory, indicating whether
something is out of stock or adding new items to the ongoing list of available items;
Manager will also be able to change the price of the items if needed. The employees can
access the customer order to package the items and have them ready for pickup.
This software has many benefits and is designed for online grocery shopping to be
quick and easy for both customers and employees. It saves time, which shoppers can


use on their family, work, and leisure. It avoids standing in line, especially during the
store’s prime hours, making the checkout process easy. Online shopping allows
customers to see items that are in and out of stock. It prevents shoppers from having to
call or go inside the store to check. Customers are far likely to overspend, buying only
what they need. Each customer can create a login to make changes to their personalized
account, which allows them to customize their shopping cart. Managers will have a
unique login, allowing them to adjust the product’s price, quantity, store details, etc.
Utilizing this software can prevent errors from being made, and it's also convenient and
user-friendly.
Any customer will be capable of managing their shopping list, searching easily
from the many products this grocery has to offer, picking up their order, and much more.
This program will ensure that all customers have access to many different products at
anytime and anywhere they go, where we will aim to increase the customer’s ease of
access. We will also try to improve or add features for the employees and the manager.
Improvements such as better sorting of the products in a department and notifying them
with certain items is low or out of stock.
